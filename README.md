BTCWolf a simple automated trader agent I am developing for fun. 

It automatically takes decisions and operates on the BTC Chinese market, so you might lose money.

There is currently implemented a single strategy, where it is sold when the price rises the one of buying time and it buys when the time decreases the one used at buy time.

For security reasons, you need to specify at runtime the following arguments:

-DAPIKey="xxxxx" -DSecretKey="yyyy" -DPassword="zzzzz"  -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/resources/logger.properties


If yoy have any feedback or questions, you can drop me a line at guifre.ruiz at the gmail dot com server.
